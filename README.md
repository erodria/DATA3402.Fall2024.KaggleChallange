Predicting Horse Health Using Random Forest.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Abstract
The objective for this repository is to use medical data to predict health outcomes for horses who have died, been eutheanized or survived. The dataset, via Kaggle Challange, was cleaned and preprocessed to prepare it for analysis. Random forest was used for the machine learning model due to it's robustness to noise and ability to handle non-linear relationships. Accuracy, precision, recal, and F-1 score metrics were calculated using train, validation and test sets. The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 81%, demonstrating the effectiveness in preducing equine health outcomes.
