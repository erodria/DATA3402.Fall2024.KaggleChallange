Predicting Horse Health Using Random Forest.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Abstract
The challange for this dataset is to use medical data to predict health outcomes for horses who have died, been eutheanized or lived. The data is cleaned and preprocessed data gathered from the Kaggle Challange datasets. Random forest was used for the machine learning technique since it is more robust to noise and works with non-linear tasks. 
# Method
